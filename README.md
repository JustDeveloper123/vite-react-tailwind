# Starter vite build on React & Tailwind

Also includes React Router v6.23+, React Redux Toolkit.

# Installation

Using common methods or the best way in my opinion using degit package:

```
npm install -g degit
npx degit JustDeveloper123/vite-react-tailwind
```

# This starter build includes

- advanced easy-controlling react routes system
- easy-understanding theme switching process (light & dark and more)
- convenient breakpoints & screens control system
- images to webp conversion. Open vite config for more details
- prettier code style, autoprefixer (cover 99.5%)
- class-variance-authority for customizable and reusable components

# F.A.Q.

- to control routes open /src/constants/router-routes.js
- changing theme colors in /src/assets/styles/themes.scss
- changing breakpoints & screens in /src/assets/styles/screens.scss
- open tailwind config to see more custom style settings & approaches
